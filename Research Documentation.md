# What is Semantic Segmentation?
    Semantic segmentation is each pixel of an image is assigned a class label.

# Why applying Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for Semantic Segmentation is important?
    NAS is known as the pocess of automaying architectural engineering. It is essential for improving the accuracy of the deep learning models. Since semantic segmentation is a fundemantal task, even a small improvment affects to many domains. 

# Why srchitecture searching for specif datasets is not important? 
    Searching architectures using NAS is costly. Therefore searching for transferable architectures were considered.
